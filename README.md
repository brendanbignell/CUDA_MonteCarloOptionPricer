# CUDA Barrier Option Pricing & Machine Learning Model Training

This a demo of how Barrier Options can be priced using Monte Carlo Simulations running on a cluster of GPUs.

The Demo constists of two parts:

# 1. CUDA Monte Carlo Simulation for pricing Barrier Options 	 
   
   Support the following barrier types:

	- Up-and-Out
	- Down-and-Out
	- Up-and-In
	- Down-and-In

	- European/American Exercise (American options use the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm)

	- Call/Put Options

	The main() function in CUDA_MonteCarloOptionPricer.cu is used to drive batch pricing of random portfolios of Barrier Options. 


   The option parameter and pricing results are written to a CSV file. A sample 100,000 option file is included in the repo.

## 2. Python Jupyter Notebooks 



demonstrates how to train a machine learning models to predict the price of a Barrier Option. For this example Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and XGBoost GBDT models were initiially evaluated. The XGBoost model was selected for further training and testing. The model was trained using the 10 million option file generated by the CUDA Monte Carlo Simulation. The GBDT model is then used to predict the price of a Barrier Option using the option parameters as input features.  Some Mathpoltlib and Ploty charts are then used to visualize the model performance.
